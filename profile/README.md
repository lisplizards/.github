# lisplizards

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the lisplizards GitHub organization.

This space is used for publishing Common Lisp libraries related to web development.

Most notable repositories:

* [vinland](https://github.com/lisplizards/vinland): web framework
* [raven](https://github.com/lisplizards/raven): URL dispatcher library

If you're not shopping for a web framework, there are still a number of libraries published
here that should work seamlessly with other existing Clack-based frameworks.

Links:

* Vinland site: https://www.vinland.dev/
* Developer blog: https://www.jnewton.dev/

NOTE: To help avoid symbol conflicts, libraries are prefixed with `foo.lisp.`, so for example Raven defines package `foo.lisp.raven`. If you find this approach to be cumbersome, you may consider using package-local nicknames in your projects.
